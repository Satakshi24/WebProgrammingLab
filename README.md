Save both these zip files in htdocs in xampp folder.

DON'T FORGET TO CREATE A DATABASE NAMING "medallion" AND IMPORT THE SQL FILE "medallion.sql" AND RUN.
WITHOUT THE DATABASE THE PROJECT WON'T RUN.
This will be done using Xampp.

Sql file "medallion" is inside database folder.

After all this is done write "localhost/ticket reservation" in a new tab for the main project.
write "localhost/feedback" for the feedback form.
